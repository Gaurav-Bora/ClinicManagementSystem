The Clinic Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the management of a medical clinic's operations. This project leverages a modern technology stack, including MySQL for database management, Node.js for the backend, and React with Bootstrap for the frontend, to create a robust and user-friendly system for efficient clinic management.

Appointment Scheduling:
Patients can book appointments online through the web application. Clinic staff can manage and confirm appointments, avoiding scheduling conflicts and reducing wait times.
